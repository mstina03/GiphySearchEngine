                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        My name is Tina. I obtained a Bachelors Degree in Computer Information Systems from Tuskegee
                        University in Tuskegee, Alabama. In 2007, I accepted a position as a windows application
                        developer with a large retail company. During the company's 2009 reorg, I accepted a position as
                        a Release Engineer where I have spent the majority of my career. As a Release Engineer my
                        responsibility transfered from building applications to releasing them. During this time I
                        acquired project and time management skills, as well as the ability to communicate with team
                        members and business customers while effectively meeting milestones and deadlines.
                        I recently accepted a Software Engineer position on a web development team were I make
                        enhancements to existing websites and assist in creating new in-house websites.<br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        As a windows developer I developer a strong backgroud in C# and VB.net. After joining a web
                        development team, my interest in website development grew. To supplement my self learning, I
                        joined a web development bootcamp and obtain a Web Development Certification from Texas A&M
                        University. Through this bootcamp I was able to grain valuable skills creating websites from
                        begining to end and now process a strong knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python. <br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        In my free time I enjoy low key things like catching up on the latest action movie, reading a
                        good romance novel, or listening to the latest audible e-book.
